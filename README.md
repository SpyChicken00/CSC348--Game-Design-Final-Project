## The Story

Dr. Benjamin Edward Anthony Roberts III has dedicated his entire life to the study of bears, and his passion for his subject knows no bounds. He has even developed the habit of forcing bear puns into every conversation without thinking about it. In conjunction with his partner Dr. Edwin Hayes, he has risen to the top of his field, but he wants to push the envelope even more. In a research proposal, he suggests integrating himself into a nearby bear community by disguising himself as a bear and living among them, recording his findings when the bears are asleep. The research board rejects his idea.

Dr. Roberts is outraged! He thought the research board was denying him the chance to cement his name among the greats in his field. He is so confident that his research would be revolutionary for the field that he decided to take matters into his own hands by sewing a bear suit for himself and going into the field. Just before leaving, he writes a letter to his colleague:


> Dear Dr. Edwin Hayes, 

> I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unfortunately our research proposal has been rejected on the grounds of “ludicrous methodology”. But since when have we resigned ourselves to the whims of our closed minded colleagues. We bear our   heart and soul to them and they claim we are not koala-fied. The nerve! You don’t become the top scientists in your field by doing the bear minimum. We built ourselves up with our bear hands, and we will do so again. We’ll see who's ludacris when we revolutionize the field. I am writing to inform you that I will be conducting our research regardless and to request that you raise funds while I am in the field. Any contributions will vastly increase the koal-ity of our work. I know it's dangerous, but don’t worry, I’ll run some trials to get my bearings. Now if you excuse me, I need to get into costume.

> Best,
> Dr. Benjamin Edward Anthony Roberst III

While in the field, Dr. Roberts had to convince the bears he was one of them by acting exactly like them. Luckily his research helped him blend in easily during most tasks, but he was still human, and had to be extremely careful in certain situations.
